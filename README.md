# LinkedIn_Data_Parsing_Project
Developed an ETL pipeline to parse LinkedIn JSON data and load it into MySQL tables, focusing on demographic and profile information. Created interactive dashboards in Power BI/Tableau, allowing users to filter profiles by name, email, and company. This project highlights my skills in data engineering, SQL, and data visualization.
